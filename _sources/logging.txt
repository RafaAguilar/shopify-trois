Logging
=======

Shopify-Trois uses requests, powered by it's own urllib3 package.

Taken from: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/?highlight=logging

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    import logging

    # these two lines enable debugging at httplib level (requests->urllib3->httplib)
    # you will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA.
    # the only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.
    import httplib
    httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1

    logging.basicConfig() # you need to initialize logging, otherwise you will not see anything from requests
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    requests_log = logging.getLogger("requests.packages.urllib3")
    requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    requests_log.propagate = True

    requests.get('http://httpbin.org/headers')
